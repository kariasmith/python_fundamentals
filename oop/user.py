class User:		
    def __init__(self):
        self.first_name = "Ada"
        self.last_name = "Lovelace"
        self.age = 42

user_ada = User()
print(user_ada.first_name)

# Create another user called user_2!

# Print user_ada's last name.
# Print user_2's last name. (Yes, they should be the same)

# Run the code, pause, go back and step through one line at a time
# What do you notice about the order it runs in?
# Write down any other questions you have.

# Sensei Exercise: try just printing the variable, user_ada.
#   What prints to the terminal?


'''
what does '->' do?

This is optional and for specifying a return type. You don't have to do this in Python but it's useful if you're looking quickly through your code and for some other reasons too\

-> None means there is no return or it returns None
-> int would mean it returns an integer
