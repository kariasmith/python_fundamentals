# Loops
'''We can use Python's range function in conjunction with python for loops to repeat the same code many 
times with a number, usually called i that represents an integer that changes. This is similar to for 
loops in other languages, but the syntax is a bit different. The range() function can have between 
1 and 3 arguments and creates a sequence of integers called a range object. We primarily use this for 
creating loops that have a defined starting point and a stopping point for a sequence of integers.

I like to think of this built in range() function as having the three S’es or “start, stop, step.” Easy to remember
