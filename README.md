Mostly notes from learning python basics.

I take notes through each section and create python files. 
Some files can run without issues and some won't because those were mostly for note taking purposes.

If you have some additions or analogies that might help keep a section or idea clear. Please share!

Why do we call it a dictionary? Think of how a classical dictionary has a word and a definition. Here, the word is the “key” you search for and the definition is the value (the meaning of that word or its human-given value).

Couple different ways to describe the brackets we see in code but I generally think of them like this:
[ ] = square brackets
{ } = curly brackets (informally called by TAs as “curly boys”
( ) = parentheses

item[“shape”] = “circle”

Just in case anyone does want to see the screen a little larger (or smaller) on your end, you can always go to the top of the Zoom screen (Almin’s screen share) and you select “View Options” and then change the zoom percentage.
